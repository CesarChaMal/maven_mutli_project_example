# Maven Multiproject Example

Example how a project (app1) can use a physical neighboring project (app2) as a dependency. 

```
multiproject_folder
|
+-----app1
|       |
|      +--pom.xml
|      |
|      +--src
|           |
|           +--main
|               |
|               +--java
|         
+-----app2
       |
       +--pom.xml
       |
       +--src
            |
            +--main
                |
                +--java
 ```
