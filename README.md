# Maven Multiproject Example

Example how a project (app2) can use a physical neighboring project (app1) as a dependency, while showing both in the same workspace.


```
multi_project_folder
       |
       +-----app1
       |       |
       |       +--pom.xml
       |       |
       |       +--src
       |           |
       |           +--main
       |               |
       |               +--java
       |         
       +-----app2
              |
              +--pom.xml
              |
              +--src
                   |
                   +--main
                       |
                       +--java
 ```
